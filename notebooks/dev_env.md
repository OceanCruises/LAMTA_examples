# Development environment

Recommended local setup (both repositories side-by-side):

```text
lamta_dev/
├─ LAMTA/           # core package
└─ LAMTA_examples/  # notebooks
```

This keeps the library and the examples aligned during development.

## VS Code

We recommend using Visual Studio Code and opening the parent folder (e.g. `lamta_dev/`) so both repositories are available in a single workspace. This makes it easy to edit the LAMTA source code and immediately test changes in the example notebooks, while keeping navigation and Git operations clear.
