## Running the notebooks

Once Jupyter is running:

1. Navigate to the `notebooks/` folder
2. Open a notebook (e.g. `Lagrangian.ipynb`)
3. Run cells interactively as needed

Some notebooks may:
- download data (internet access required),
- take several minutes to compute,
- require significant memory depending on configuration.
