**LAMTA_examples** is a collection of tutorial notebooks illustrating
Lagrangian trajectory analysis and diagnostics using the **LAMTA** framework.

The notebooks are designed to:
- demonstrate typical workflows,
- visualise trajectories and diagnostics,
- serve as practical starting points for users and developers of LAMTA.
